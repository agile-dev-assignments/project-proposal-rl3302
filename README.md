# Project Proposal: Cheerie

## What and why?
Cheerie is a mood tracker, journal, and/or scheduler that will send you nice messages when you are down. During this time when friends and family are separated during the pandemic, this app will keep them connected and help promote mental health.

## For whom? 
Targeted towards students to young working adults, or anyone who wants happy messages to brighten up their days. 

## How?
This project will be a platform (app or web app) that allows users to 
1. Create and login to a personalized accounts 

2. Rate their mood for that time of the day and the data will be saved in a database 

3. Analyze mood patterns and trends. Display these on a calendar with color-coded mood indicators (e.g. green - doing well, yellow - doing ok, red - not doing ok)

4. When the system notices a downward trend in the user's mood, it will send the user a cheerful message 

5. Messages can be customized and personalized according to the user's taste

## Scope
This project has flexibility in that it has a lot of varying features (from easy to challenging ones) that can be added to the project. 

Expandability (optional features that can implemented, time permitting): 
* allow user to add friends
* pings user's friends to remind them to chat the user when the user isn't doing well
* custom messages
* scheduling
* statistics (analyze mood trends and displays them in charts)
* chat options
