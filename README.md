# Project Proposal: Cheerie

## What and why?
Cheerie is a mood tracker, journal, and/or scheduler that will send you nice messages when you are down. During this time when friends and family are separated during the pandemic, this app will keep them connected and help promote mental health.

## For whom? 
Targeted towards students to young working adults. 

## How?
This project will be design a platform (app or web app) that allows users to login to their accounts and rate their mood for that time of the day. The system will send you a message when it notices a downward trend in your mood. 

## Scope
This project has flexibility in that it has a lot of varying features (from easy to challenging ones) that can be added to the project. 

Expandability (optional features that can implemented, time permitting): 
* allow user to add friends
* pings user's friends to remind them to chat the user when the user isn't doing well
* custom messages
* scheduling
* statistics (analyze mood trends and displays them in charts)
* chat options
